#When a player chooses a column, the token drops down to the lowest, unoccupied space
#- For our game, the board will be 6 x 6
#- Each time a player adds a token to the board, your game should check if they won, and also update the board and reprint it
#- Players tokens can be whatever you wantâ€¦ Xs and Os, 1s and 2s, Rs and Bs, etc.
